> Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence sounds like such an abstract concept that it’s sometimes hard to imagine how it could be helpful. Most of the time.

For this reason, AI is very relevant to marketing when used to analyse current customer data. Based on the conclusions of AI, you can predict what kind of prospects would be interested in your products and services, and where to find them. AI can also be used as a social media listening device to keep tabs on what your competitors are doing.

> Chatbot

Love them or hate them, chatbot have well and truly landed. “What’s a chatbot?” you may ask. A chatbot is a little digital helper who appears on websites to answer FAQs and help customers get the information they need as easily as possible. Some of them might talk to you, while some of them might just pop up with a question on the screen, usually something like, “how can I help you today?”
It’s estimated that by 2022, businesses will have saved over $8 billion per year due to the automation possible through chatbot. Just bear in mind that they work best when answering simple questions rather than attempting complex conversations. For questions of greater complexity, it’s always best to get a human to field the enquiry rather than risk customer frustration.

> Live Video
What’s a more effective marketing tool than video? Live video of course! While the thought might be a little nerve wracking, the instantaneous nature of live video adds a level of credibility that’s hard to beat when it’s done the right way. You can’t hide anything in a live video, and that’s what makes it such a strong tool for building trust with prospective customers.

But just because live video can be a little experimental doesn’t mean you’ll be flying without an aerial map of the city in the form of a solid content strategy. If you don’t have a content strategy, have a good brainstorm and figure one out, or consult a marketing agency to help you create one.
Once you’ve got the strategy in place, you can pick your platform; anything from Facebook Live, YouTube Live, Instagram Live and etc. Don’t be afraid to take advantage of live video.
