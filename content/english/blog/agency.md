> Good First Impressions

A user’s first impression of your website is 94% all about the design of your site. That’s a big percentage!. So if your website looks great – and it has useful relevant content, as we always harp on about on this blog – then your credibility rating with potential clients soars! But conversely, if your website design looks subpar or takes a century to load, then you’re in trouble. Your credibility and company likeability factor will plummet and people will click off your website as quickly as possible.

> Display Your Products and Services 

86% of visitors will go straight for your products or services page before they go anywhere else on your site. So please, don’t hide away this page in some dark corner of your website. Your visitors need to know what you do, and they need to know if your services or products are relevant to what they want. If they get lost trying to figure out where your services are hiding, they’ll leave your site in a huff and they won’t be back.

> Content

Did you know that your potential customers will spend an average of 5.59 seconds reading your content before making a (very quick) judgement call on its relevance, quality and credibility? That means that you need to put together the best quality SEO content you can to reel potential clients in. So not only do you need an eye-pleasing website design, you also need high-quality content to give that design substance and make it relevant to your customer. To make your content easier to digest, consider packaging some of it in other forms such as videos, charts or interactive elements.

> Users Won’t Return After a Bad Experience

Just like offline customers, once a visitor has had a bad experience with your company via your website, it’s likely they won’t return to your site. This is especially true if that was their first time visiting. Any slightly negative experience such as a website taking a few extra seconds to load can easily put potential customers off. So make sure your website looks beautiful, functions well and displays great content to keep people coming back!
