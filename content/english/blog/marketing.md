> Why Your Digital Marketing Isn’t Working

There’s a lot of hype about digital marketing It’s the answer to your prayers. “Then why isn’t it working?” you may ask. Well, your magic rabbit still needs the right conditions to do what you want it to – that is, capture leads, build brand awareness and sell your products or services. And while we hate to point the finger here, sometimes it’s the magician’s fault. That’s right ­­– the person at the controls. 

> Digital Marketing Strategy

In order to move towards success, you need to know what that means in tangible terms. Why do you want to invest in digital marketing? What do you want to get out of it? Make your goals SMART ones, ensuring they’re Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timely. Don’t try to meet all of your goals at once. Start with the most important ones and build from there.

> Target Audience

If you don’t have a pre-existing audience on social media or a stream of traffic on your website, it’s likely that you’re not being heard, with your voice bouncing off the walls and ricocheting back at you. If you find yourself in this situation, a digital agency in Melbourne should be able to advise you on outreach tactics to help you build your audience.

> Not Capturing or Following Up on Leads

Leads should be treated like liquid gold by business owners. You need ways of getting them, and once you have them, you need to follow up on them. What are we talking about here? Lead generation can involve offering useful PDFs in exchange for email addresses on your website, implementing contact forms, or even including a short paragraph at the end of a blog post to encourage people to call. Once you’ve got a lead, make sure you follow up on it.
