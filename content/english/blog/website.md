> User-Friendly

Remember that websites are made for the people who will be browsing them online. A website needs to therefore achieve certain objectives in reaching and entertaining its target audience. It needs to be engaging enough as a source of information that users want to stay on the site for a good length of time. If your website can keep people on it for longer – and this is where SEO and great content writing comes in – then you’re halfway there to generating more leads, business and profit for yourself, all by offering a genuinely useful service to your customers.

> Take Advantage of Online Tools

There are a plethora of online tools available to help you with good website design if you’re not hiring a digital agency in Melbourne to design your site for you. You might already be using the Adobe Creative Suite of products, but other notable names include Genius, Logo Lab and Maze. Google these tools and test out their capabilities for yourself, enabling you to improve on different aspects of web design.


> Content

White space isn’t the same as empty space. On a website, white space, or negative space as it’s also called, has an important function. The gaps between sections, headings and blocks of text let the content breathe. Why is this important? It makes the information on the website easier to take in for users. It also avoids a cluttered look and helps the website to give a more professional impression.

> Trends

When you make use of trends in web design, you’re instantly putting an expiry date on the look of your website. For example, a past trend in web design was to always use stock photography. But these days, stock photography has been replaced by more unique and customized images that really express the personality of a company. People don’t want bland, perfect and generic anymore − that’s boring. Today’s customers want to know you and what makes your business different. Part of this can be conveyed by the way you design your website if you steer clear of trends and stay true to your brand.
