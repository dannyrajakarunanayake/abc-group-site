> Improve Google Rankings
As of April 21st, Google will roll out a new update to their search algorithm, which will take into account a website’s mobile friendliness.
Sites that are responsive will be given a boost in rankings, while sites that fail to provide a mobile-friendly experience.
The algorithm is expected to have a big impact on rankings, making it a good idea to implement a responsive website before its release.

> Enable greater access to your site
In addition to helping your search rankings, a responsive website enables easier access to your site, attracting more visitors.
If a mobile user tries to access your site on the go and it isn’t mobile friendly, they’re not likely to persist – they might even turn to one of your competitors instead!
Allowing easy access to your site at all times on a range of platforms will ensure it can attract and retain visitors.

> Cost-effective and easy to manage

Some websites have created a dedicated mobile site to enable easy viewing on portable devices. However, mobile sites have several drawbacks.
They often lack many of the features and functionality of full sites, and also require more time, effort and money to implement and maintain.
Fortunately, a responsive website provides a single solution that’s viewable on all devices and screen sizes – they automatically detect the device being used and adjust accordingly, displaying the same content to fit the specific screen it’s being viewed on.
